For the last week I have been in Berlin! We were invited by Amazon Berlin to visit their offices. The visit was from Monday to Wednesday, so me 
and a few other CDT students arrived a few days before to enjoy the weekend in Berlin. I signed an NDA, and I do not want to risk being sued, but 
I will say that the visit was very interesting - with a lot of talks ranging from theoretical statistics to applied machine learning! 
It ended with a joint StatML - Amazon dinner which was delicious and a lot of fun! Looking forward to returning soon!
