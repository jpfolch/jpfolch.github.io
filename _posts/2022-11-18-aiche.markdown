I was pleased to present SnAKe at the annual AIChE (American Institute of Chemical Engineers) 
conference, in Phoenix, AZ, USA. There were a lot of interesting talks about combining 
Chemical Engineering with Machine Learning, and I was able to meet many interesting people! I 
am looking forward to attend more conferences in the near future.
