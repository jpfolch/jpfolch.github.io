I am pleased to announce that our latest paper, "Combining Multi-Fidelity Modelling and 
Asynchronous Batch Bayesian Optimization" has been accepted into the latest issue of the 
journal Computers & Chemical Engineering. The link to the publication can be found 
[here](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0098135423000637). We also made 
videos detailing the work, both a [short](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/CSC0GvspJfU) and a 
[long](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JQB3nlhMfoA) version.
