I recently return from Levi, Finland, where I attended BayesComp 2023. The conference 
explored the latest Bayesian computational methods, such as MCMC and variational Bayes. It 
was very fun to get to learn about the latest research, see how it is applied to 
the real world, and to catch up with some friends. The conference is also colloquially known 
as MCMSki, as the conference centre 
was in the middle of a ski resort! During my time there, I took the opportunity to learn to 
snowboard and to see the aurora borealis.
