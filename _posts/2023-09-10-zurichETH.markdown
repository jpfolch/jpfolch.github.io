I have just returned from finishing an academic placement at ETH Zurich, at the [LAS](https://las.inf.ethz.ch) research group led by [Andreas Krause](https://las.inf.ethz.ch/krausea). During my time there I had the privilage of working closely with [Mojm√≠r Mutny](https://mojmirmutny.github.io). It was an extremely rewarding experience, and I hope everyone will see the amazing work we did together as a publication soon. Zurich is now one of my favourities cities, surrounded by beautiful nature, and with the most amazing food. Find below a few pictures I took during a weekend hike!
