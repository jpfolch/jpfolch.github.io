Excited to announce I have joined [SOLVE Chemistry](https://www.solvechemistry.com) as co-founder and CSO! Founded by [Linden Schrecker](https://www.linkedin.com/in/linden-schrecker/) and backed by [Creator Fund](https://thecreatorfund.com), [Chemovator](https://www.chemovator.com), and [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk); SOLVE is a company specializing in improving chemical processes through innovative data collection and machine learning approaches. I am looking forward to applying all I researched and learnt during my PhD to help the chemical industry become more efficient.
