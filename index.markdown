My name is Jose Pablo Folch. I am the chief scientific officer and co-founder of [SOLVE](https://solvechemistry.com). Our goal is to empower the chemical industry to become as efficient and sustainable as possible through efficient data-gathering and state-of-the-art machine learning and AI techniques. In particular, I focus on Bayesian optimization, Bayesian modelling, design of experiments, and uncertainty reduction techniques.

I am also in the process of finishing my PhD from Imperial College London, under the supervision of [Ruth 
Misener](https://wp.doc.ic.ac.uk/rmisener/) and [Mark van der Wilk](https://mvdw.uk). During my PhD I worked on Bayesian optimization problems, inspired by 
applications to flow chemistry, funded by, and working in collaboration with [BASF](https://www.basf.com/gb/en.html). 

I was born and raised in Mexico City, before doing my GCSEs and A-levels in Stonyhurst College, Lancashire, UK. I also graduated from Colegio 
Vista Hermosa in Mexico. After school, I moved to London to study Mathematics in Imperial College, where I graduated in 2020 with first class 
honours. I joined the [StatML CDT](https://statml.io) to pursue a PhD on the same year.

My main research interests include machine learning, Bayesian optimization, Gaussian processes, and decision making under uncertainty.
